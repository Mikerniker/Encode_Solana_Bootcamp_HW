1. Discuss what a decentralised version of a game like monopoly would be like, if there was no software on a central server. Consider: What are the essential pieces of
functionality? How could people cheat? and How could you prevent them from cheating?

Functionality:
- In a decentralized version of Monopoly, the game would rely on distributed ledger technology (such as blockchain) to execute transactions. 
- Each player would have their own copy of the game board and would interact directly with each other through peer-to-peer communication. 
- Essential functionalities would include:
  - Distributed ledger for tracking property ownership, transactions, and player balances.
  - Peer-to-peer communication for players to negotiate trades, purchase properties, and pay rents.
  - Smart contracts to automate game rules, such as rent calculation, property development, and jail penalties.

Cheating: 
- Players could:
  - Tamper with their local game client to manipulate dice rolls or property ownership.
  - Collude with others to unfairly gain advantages, such as trading properties at artificially low prices.
  - Attempt double spending or other fraudulent transactions on the distributed ledger.

To Prevent Cheating:
- Cryptographic techniques could secure game transactions and prevent tampering.
- Implementing consensus mechanisms to validate transactions and ensure that all players agree on the game state.
- Regular audits and monitoring of game transactions to detect any suspicious activities.
- Implement penalties for cheating, such as forfeiting assets or being temporarily banned from the game.

2. Do you feel that Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are a move towards decentralisation? Will they help or hinder adoption of other cryptocurrencies?
Move Towards Decentralization: 
- CBDCs represent a digitized form of fiat currency issued by central banks. 
- While they introduce digital innovations, they are not inherently decentralized as they are controlled and regulated by 
central authorities. 
- However, they could potentially leverage decentralized technologies like blockchain for certain functionalities.
- Some argue that CBDCs could hinder the adoption of decentralized cryptocurrencies by providing a government-backed 
digital alternative that may be perceived as more trustworthy and stable. 
- On the other hand, CBDCs could also serve as a gateway for mainstream users to explore and understand digital currencies, potentially leading to increased adoption of cryptocurrencies in general. 
- Ultimately, the impact will depend on various factors including government regulations, technological advancements, and public perception.
