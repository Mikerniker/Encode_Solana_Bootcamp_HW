###LESSON 3 

The text outlines lessons on Solana Command Line Tools, Rust, and Rust concepts like ownership, references, strings, traits, generics, vectors, iterators, and shadowing. 
- **Solana Command Line Tools:** 
Instructions for installing, creating a keypair, connecting to the dev network, getting tokens, transferring SOL, and checking balances.
- **Rust Continued:** Explanation of idiomatic Rust, memory management (stack vs. heap), ownership, copying, moving, references, dereferencing, string data types, traits, generics, vectors, iterators, and shadowing.
- **Idiomatic Rust:** Different design patterns compared to other languages.
- **Memory Management:** Stack for fixed-size data, heap for variable-size data, Rust's approach to memory cleanup.
- **Ownership:** Ensures memory safety, prevents issues like dangling pointers.
- **Copying and Moving:** Simple data types are copied, complex types follow ownership rules.
- **References and Borrowing:** Allows accessing values without ownership, ensures safety.
- **String Data Types:** Stored on the heap, composed of a pointer, length, and capacity.
- **Traits:** Define behavior for types, similar to interfaces.
- **Generics:** Parameterize across data types, avoid duplication.
- **Vectors:** Dynamic arrays, creation, addition, retrieval, iteration.
- **Iterators:** Efficient, lazily evaluated, used for iteration.
- **Shadowing:** Re-declaring variables within scope.
