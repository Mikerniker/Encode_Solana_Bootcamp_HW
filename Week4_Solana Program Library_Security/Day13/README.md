1. Should projects spend more on security ?
Yes, projects should prioritize spending on security. 
Decentralization and trustlessness are key factors in blockchain, 
so security is essential. Security breaches can cause
significant financial losses, damage reputation, and undermine the basic principles 
of blockchain technology.

2. What measures would you take to improve security ?

Some measures that can be taken to improve security:

- Regular security audits: Conducting thorough and regular security audits by 
independent third-party experts to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses
in the system.
- Penetration testing: Employing ethical hackers to simulate real-world attacks 
on the system can uncover potential security loopholes.
- Code review: Implementing strict code review processes to ensure that all code
changes adhere to best practices and security standards.

3. Should bounties be paid to attackers after the exploit ?

Paying bounties may incentivize attackers to 
continue exploiting vulnerabilities, but it can encourage 
responsible disclosure and cooperation. It's difficult to say since we may 
never really know the attacker's intentions.
